# Sudoku Solver

- Create a file named input.txt to feed input to the file, where every cell is space seperated and if the cell is empty, enter a 0. For example, sample input: <br>
```
4 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0
0 9 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 3 0 0 9 6 0 8
0 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 0
6 0 0 5 0 0 8 0 2
0 0 0 0 0 8 0 7 0
0 0 6 0 0 1 9 0 3
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0
5 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0
```

- Compile and execute the cpp file, and if there exists a solution, you will get the solution, otherwise, the code will return "Unsolvable".
